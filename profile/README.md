# OpenELA

OpenELA is a trade association of open source Enterprise Linux distribution
developers founded in support of the spirit of open source to create continuity
for all Enterprise Linux downstream distributions. Our mission is to provide a
secure, transparent, and reliable Enterprise Linux source that is globally
available to all as a buildable base.

The long term success of our mission is ensured through the formation of this
foundation with complete commitment to non-partisanship, transparency,
community, inclusivity, and public benefit.

OpenELAâ€™s primary function is to provide a consistent and secure upstream
location for all who are interested in Enterprise Linux distribution sources.
The success of this project will enable anyone to create and distribute a
downstream variant of Enterprise Linux built by and for the community with
dedicated contributions from market leading vendors and joint collaboration
with community contributors. Anyone and everyone will have transparent access
throughout the Enterprise Linux lifecycle without limitations.
